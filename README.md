# Creating implicit task-sets from categorical stimuli: when structure learning degrades incidental memory

Adaptive behavior is facilitated by our ability to discover and leverage rules for classifying and linking stimuli to appropriate actions. Previous studies have shown that when humans learn stimulus-response associations for two-dimensional stimuli, they implicitly form and generalize abstract rule structures. However, how such structure building affects memory is poorly understood. Here, we manipulated how trial-unique images mapped onto responses to bias spontaneous task-set formation and investigated the effects of structure learning on incidental stimulus encoding. Across four experiments, participants performed a learning task that allowed for motor-clustering of stimulus-action rules according to stimulus dimensions (e.g., age/gender). For “non-clustered” learners, the category-response mapping was arbitrary; for “clustered” learners, the mapping was clustered along a higher-level dimension (e.g., gender). During structure learning, participants could attend more to stimulus features, resulting in better subsequent memory. Alternately, learning appropriate task-sets might impose demands on working memory, diverting attention away from stimulus encoding. We found that all learners generate hierarchical task-sets for grouping trial-unique stimuli into categories, and this tendency is robustly enhanced when stimulus-response mappings encourage dimensional grouping. However, consistent with higher demands on working memory, implicit structure learning comes with a cost: the early phase of spontaneous task-set formation is associated with diminished task stimulus encoding. This effect occurred only when images were task-relevant and regardless of whether task-sets were implicitly discovered or explicitly instructed. Thus, structure learning promotes cognitive flexibility, but can also impair incidental memory, suggesting a mechanism by which multi-tasking results in poorer behavioral outcomes.
