# Creating implicit task-sets from categorical stimuli: when structure learning degrades incidental memory

Humans are characterized by their ability to leverage rules for classifying and linking stimuli to context-appropriate actions. Previous studies have shown that when humans learn stimulus-response associations for two-dimensional stimuli, they implicitly form and generalize hierarchical rule structures. However, the mechanisms underlying structure formation are poorly understood. Across four experiments, we manipulated how trial-unique images mapped onto responses to bias spontaneous task-set formation and investigated structure learning through the lens of incidental stimulus encoding. Participants performed a learning task that allowed for clustering of stimulus-action rules according to stimulus dimensions. For “non-clustered” learners, category-response mappings were arbitrary; for “clustered” learners, the mappings were motor-clustered along a higher-level dimension. During structure learning, participants might attend more to stimulus features, resulting in better subsequent memory. Alternatively, building task-sets might impose demands on working memory, diverting attention away from stimulus encoding. We found that all participants generated hierarchical task-sets for grouping trial-unique stimuli into categories, and this tendency was enhanced for clustered learners. Furthermore, consistent with demands on working memory, structure learning incurred a cost: the early phase of spontaneous task-set formation was associated with diminished stimulus encoding. This behavioral cost occurred for task-relevant images for task-sets that were implicitly discovered and instructed.
