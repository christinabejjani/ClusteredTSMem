In each folder, you'll find CSV files for each task phase (MP = memory phase; LP = learning phase; Filler = filler phase; SourceMemColor = source memory color questions; SourceMemShape = source memory shape questions).

Feel free to email me at christina . bejjani @ duke.edu if you have any questions about what each of the variables represents. There are some redundant variables in there because I like having multiple checkpoints.
