We obtained face images from several databases (Bainbridge, Isola, and Oliva, 2013; Ebner, Riediger, and Lindenberger, 2010; http://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html) and Google searches for older men and women under a noncommercial reuse with modification license.

In this folder are face images that I found via my Google searches. I am only providing these images for the sake of open science; please assume the same license is in play, and do not use the images for commercial purposes.
