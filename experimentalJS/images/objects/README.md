We obtained object images from the Cabeza lab database (http://cabezalab.org/cabezalabobjects/) and Google searches of images with a license for noncommercial reuse with modification.

In this folder are object images that I found via my Google searches. I am only providing these images for the sake of open science; please assume the same license is in play, and do not use the images for commercial purposes.
