*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* Of note, you can also probably optimize the code for this experiment (there are a lot of repeated segments, etc.).

This experiment was run in March 2018 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

To counterbalance dimensions around which clustering biases were formed and manipulate clustering biases, we ran four task versions. Two versions were essentially duplicates, but with clustered instead of non-clustered motor mappings. We did not have a priori hypotheses about whether participants would prefer to use or age/gender (Experiments 2-4) as supraordinate dimensions, so we ran clustered mapping versions for each dimension. You'll see four corresponding task versions. The code will differ slightly for each of these different parameters (e.g., the category-response associations). To run the experiment, you would download the task folder, put it somewhere where html is public (published on github? dropbox? or if your university has a personal home directory, as Duke does), and list the Main Menu file as the "Survey Link" on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Please note that I also did not include my IRB's Informed Consent JavaScript here, but you would need to include that in the "main menu" file where mine is currently mentioned.
