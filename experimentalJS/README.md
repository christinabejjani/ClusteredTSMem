*Please contact me at christina.bejjani AT duke.edu if you are planning on using this code for an experiment.* Of note, you can also probably optimize the code for this experiment (there are a lot of repeated segments, etc.).

These experiments were run in early 2018 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

I've also uploaded here a PDF of the Qualtrics questionnaire that was inserted into the task JS with Demographics and some basic questions for participants to answer about the task.

In the images folder are the images that I found via Google search. The rest, you'd have to get permission to use from the other databases whose images we used.
